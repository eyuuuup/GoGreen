My plan for self development:

During the OOP project, I want to develop my programming skill about using Java. Since my first try of Java at first quarter was not successful, this time i will fully participate in shared lab and get help from TA. Also, for each week during the team meeting I will try to find the good coding method by cooperate with my teammate. Individually, I start the code-academy for learn the basic uses of IntelliJ.

My plan for self development:

My Strong point for a project is that once I start something, I’m very determined to go on until it’s done, to deliver a half implemented result makes me feel very bad. In a team this will be visible in my motivation and determination to finish the project in a proper way. Next to that I want my code to be really clear for everyone, such that everyone understands it, which is nice for teammates.

My weak point is that once I have created a vision on something, I really want to do it that way. This is a very bad thing for cooperation, as other members will have great ideas, where mine won’t be that good most of the times, so I shouldn’t see my ideas as the only way things should be done. Next to that I want to be involved into everything, which isn’t really helpful when you are in a team of 7.

Because of my weak point, teamwork is my biggest goal in this course, to be concrete: I want to be a great team member during meetings, and to listen to everyone’s ideas. Next to that I want to have a clear work distribution.

In reality this process will take time, I don’t think in the first week I will be very productive during the first meeting, and I don’t think the schedule for the first week will be really effective, but during the process I want to grow in planning and cooperation. 

In order to achieve my goals, I think it’s really important to reflect on my work over the weeks. During meetings I should really pay attention whether everyone has the opportunity to tell their ideas, and I should not push my own ideas.

I will therefor always prepare meetings, attend them in an active way, and make sure I discuss everything before I start implementing something.

My plan for self development:

My goal during the course is getting better at Java because I want to pass my Algorithms and Data-structures exam, if I pass my exam I will consider this goal achieved.

Currently, I'm making extra exercises on places like LeetCode to practice my Java skills, and I can  recognise that I'm not familiar enough with Java to have a clear idea on what I'm doing. I need to search a lot of stuff up and really think about it, thus I want to reach the level of skill so that I can quickly know what to do when starting to code something.

A lot of practice is required to achieve this goal, and there's probably no better way of achieving this goal than practice. During the course I hope to get to know more about Java, and my teammates will probably be a big part in this, furthermore together with practice on my own I hope to achieve my goal.

#### Personal Development Plan

Working on some software group project in the past, showed me just how hard it is to utilise multiple people in one software project. During this course I hope to improve my **collaboration skills** and gain knowledge of how to **work effectively together**. I am looking forward to learning new methods of **task distribution** and **team management**. Besides teamwork, I hope to get familiar with **git version control** and improve my overall programming skills. Furthermore, I am perfectionist, which means I spend too much time on things that do not matter. I want to learn how to plan and **manage my time** to focus on important tasks and thus **improving my effectiveness**.

To attaining given goals:
- I will communicate with my group-mates openly and often
- I will research connected topics deeply to fully understand them
- I will plan thoroughly, this will allow me focus on important things and suppress my habit of wasting time

Reaching those goals will not be easy but with enough dedication, it will be manageable. To maintain my dedication I can simply remind myself that I am working on a fun group project with my peeps and that the sole process of doing so is rewarding enough. :)

My plan for self development:

My strength is to achieve goals and not give up even if they seem almost impossible.

My main goals are learning how to manipulate git and also learning how to work as a part of a large software team. The way I intend to do this is to proactively take part in the team and stop myself from trying to be overly independent. With github I intend to get familiar as much as I can.

My plan for self development:

Strong points:
My strong points are that I'm creative, and if I find it a fun project I will work hard on it. and will stay motivated. This is shown in a team by that I am prepared to do a extra thing, or want a more visual end product.

Weaker points:
My weaker points are that I'm very chaotic, and they say I'm a little perfectionistic. How this is shown in a team is that I am all over the place with helping and ideas. And that I can be a real pain in the ass about for example something that is not centered.

G(oal)
My first goal is to learn how to work efficient together.
My second goal is to learn how to realistic plan.
these goals are important to me because these are useful life skills. For university and later when you work at a company.
I think that I have succeeded when we have a beautiful product where everyone can be proud of.


R(eality)
I think that I am actively working on my goal. I try to plan realistic every day, and also work together at home or at school.
I think the working together is going pretty well. But we haven’t worked on a big project like this yet. But the planning can use a lot of improvement. Now I plan but I don’t execute it correct and on time.

(O)ptions
Options to reach my goal are:
Plan less so it is doable
Keep communicating with my team and help, or ask for help when needed

The option I want to use the most is the second option. I think that that option will benefit me the most.
The thing that is stopping me is myself. If I want feedback or something, than I should ask for it. So I need to activate myself.

(W)ill
I’m going to communicate clearly with my team to reach my goal. Also I’m going to plan a more realistic plan for this project. So that I will finish everything that I need to do.
This I need to do from the beginning. Starting from week 3 is too late. So I start now. By making sure to keep communicating with my team, and stay involved with them.
My teammates can help me achieve this goal by also communicating. And also make a clear planning for themselves. So To achieve my goal I have to do the following things:
Communicate with the team
Plan a realistic planning, not too much
Change the planning if you can’t make it, keep changing is the key
Ask for help is needed
Help other people if they need help
And more communication

My plan for self development:

The main things I want to develop upon for this project, are my programming skills in Java and the ability to work in a big group.
OOP the first quarter didn't go as planned, as I failed the course horribly, but I will do my best to fix my lack of Java.
Of course I have worked in a group before, for all kinds of projects, however this wil be my first time working in a group this big for a project that will take a whole quarter. I can imagine that there will be lots of different problems coming our way these coming weeks, but I am sure that if we communicate properly and do our work on time (the latter where i have to work hard on) we can do very well on this project.
