My plan for self development:

During the OOP project, I want to develop my programming skill about using Java. Since my first try of Java at first quarter was not successful, this time i will fully participate in shared lab and get help from TA. Also, for each week during the team meeting I will try to find the good coding method by cooperate with my teammate. Individually, I start the code-academy for learn the basic uses of IntelliJ.

My plan for self development:

This is the first time I have to work in a group of 7, which I didn't know before the project started. To functionally cooperate with this group is my biggest goal. Next to that I want to improve in developing applications from scratch. During the process I hope to pick up some IntelliJ skills.

My plan for self development:

My goal during the course is getting better at Java because I want to pass my Algorithms and Data-structures exam, if I pass my exam I will consider this goal achieved.

Currently, I'm making extra exercises on places like LeetCode to practice my Java skills, and I can  recognise that I'm not familiar enough with Java to have a clear idea on what I'm doing. I need to search a lot of stuff up and really think about it, thus I want to reach the level of skill so that I can quickly know what to do when starting to code something.

A lot of practice is required to achieve this goal, and there's probably no better way of achieving this goal than practice. During the course I hope to get to know more about Java, and my teammates will probably be a big part in this, furthermore together with practice on my own I hope to achieve my goal.

My plan for self development:

Working on some software group project in the past, showed me just how hard it is to utilise multiple people in one software project. During this course I hope to improve my _collaboration skills_ and gain knowledge of how to _work effectively together_. I am looking forward to learning new methods of _task distribution_ and _team management_.

Furthermore, I hope to get familiar with _git version control_ and improve my overall programming skills.
