My plan for self develop: 

During the OOP project, I want to develop my programming skill about using Java. Since my first try of Java at first quater was not successful, this time i wull fully participate in shared lab and get help from TA. Also, for each week during the team meeting I will try to find the good coding method by cooperate with my teammate. Individually, I start the code-accademy for learn the basic uses of Intellij.

My plan for self develop:

This is the first time I have to work in a group of 7, which I didn't know before the project started. To functionally cooperate with this group is my biggest goal. Next to that I want to improve in developing applications from scratch. During the process I hope to pick up some Intellij skills.
